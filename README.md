# FabWeave Operations Lab

FabWeave is a dependency-light Python reference project for semiconductor-fab
operations.  Its production modules model queue-time protection, dispatch,
reticle reservations, recipe qualification, SPC, metrology sampling,
maintenance, chamber matching, holds, genealogy, chemical aging, cleanroom
excursions, demand control, rework, lot merging, equipment dedication,
contamination, takt, route yield and shipment commitments.

A bitemporal capacity calendar stacks line shutdowns, holidays, shortened
shifts and temporary overtime onto the same day.  Overlapping minutes resolve
through an explicit precedence chain - shutdown > holiday > shortened > base
overtime - computed on half-open minute intervals so adjacent windows never
double-count.  Rules are append-only on two time axes (valid window versus
recorded-at); a historical date is answered from the rule version known then,
and late additions or corrections surface as explicit drift instead of
silently rewriting a past answer.

The cross-domain workflow layer composes these services for material
readiness, dispatch-after-hold, qualified reservations and assignments,
metrology/SPC gates, containment, powered scheduling, rework release,
merge-to-commit and performance reporting.  It preserves domain rejection
reasons instead of replacing them with a generic success or failure.

Shared infrastructure supplies half-open time intervals, versioned policy
history, immutable decisions, quantity conservation and an append-only event
log with optimistic concurrency.  Domain services use these primitives to keep
event-time, idempotency and fail-closed behavior consistent.

Run the tests with `python -m pytest -q`.
